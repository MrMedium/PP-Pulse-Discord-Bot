1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Pulse (“the Bot”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, stores, and protects data when you use or interact with it on Discord.

By using Pulse, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy and the Terms of Service. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the Bot.

2. Information We Collect

Pulse only collects the minimum amount of data required to operate and provide its features effectively. Data collected may include:

2.1 Basic Identifiers

User IDs — Used to identify command senders, maintain preferences, or apply permissions.

Server (Guild) IDs — Used to store configuration data or settings specific to each server.

Channel IDs & Message IDs — Used only when a command requires a specific message or channel context.

2.2 Configuration Data

When server administrators set up Pulse, configuration data (such as prefix, role IDs, or feature toggles) may be stored to maintain those settings.

2.3 Usage Data

The Bot may collect anonymous command usage statistics and event logs, such as:

Command name and frequency of use

Execution time and success/failure logs

Error or crash reports

This data helps improve reliability and optimize performance.

2.4 Temporary Data

Some information may be temporarily stored in memory while the Bot is active (e.g., ongoing command states or session caches). This data is never permanently saved and is cleared upon restart.

3. How We Use the Information

Collected data is used strictly for operational, moderation, and improvement purposes. Specifically, Pulse may use the data to:

Execute and process commands requested by users.

Save and apply server-specific settings.

Ensure moderation and anti-abuse functionality.

Monitor stability and performance.

Debug and fix technical issues.

Pulse does not use data for advertising, profiling, or any commercial purposes.

4. Data Retention

Persistent configuration data (e.g., server settings) is stored until the Bot is removed from the server or a deletion request is made.

Temporary data (e.g., command states) is cleared automatically upon restart.

Logs and usage data may be stored for diagnostic purposes but are anonymized and periodically purged.

5. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, or share your data with any third parties.
However, data may be shared in the following limited circumstances:

With Discord, Inc. — As required for the Bot to function via the Discord API.

For Legal Reasons — If required by law, or to respond to valid legal requests such as subpoenas or court orders.

We will never disclose private or identifying user information unless legally compelled.

6. Data Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect all stored data, including:

Restricting access to data to the Bot owner and trusted system administrators.

Using secure hosting environments and encryption where possible.

Regularly updating the Bot to patch vulnerabilities.

Despite these measures, no system is completely secure. Use of Pulse is at your own risk.

7. User Rights

You have the right to:

Request data deletion: Ask for removal of all server or user-related data.

Request data review: Ask to see what configuration data (if any) is stored for your server.

Withdraw consent: Stop using the Bot at any time by removing it from your server.

Requests should be sent directly to mediumwarrior67 via Discord or the official support channel.

8. Children’s Privacy

Pulse is not intended for users under 13 years of age, in accordance with Discord’s own Terms of Service.
We do not knowingly collect data from minors. If you believe a user under 13 has interacted with the Bot, contact us immediately to have their data removed.

9. Third-Party Links

Pulse may occasionally display or provide links to external websites (for example, documentation or media content).
We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of any third-party sites or services.

10. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time to reflect changes in how Pulse operates or in compliance with new regulations.
All updates will take effect immediately upon posting. The date at the top of this document will indicate the latest revision.

Continued use of Pulse after changes means you accept the updated terms.
